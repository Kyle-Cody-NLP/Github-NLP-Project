## [Final Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18Wb5EudIDU5466MhY4ZSC0h1SIAOMYk88jk7FNETzL8/edit#slide=id.p)

## Executive Summary: 

## Deliverables: 
- Final notebook with research process, well-labeled visualizations, models, and findings
- Link to Google Slides presentation with 2-5 slides 
- 5-6 minute presentation 

## Project Goals:
- Identify elements fo a README contents in order to predict the Github repository's primary programming language. 
- Create a predictive model that can take in the text of a Github repository's README and determine that repository's primary language.

## Project Description:
- This project aimed to build a model that can predict the main programming language of a repository, given the text of a README file. The team built a dataset based on the README files of repositories dealing with Cryptography, explored different aspects of the README files, and built models that predicted the programming language used in the repository based on the README files. 

## Project Plan:
- Acquire the data from Github Repositories and store the function in the acquire.py file.
- Clean the data with functions found in the prepare.py file.
- Explore the data and ask questions to clarify what is actually happening.
  - Ensure to properly annotate, comment, and use markdowns.
  - Store functions used in a wrangle.py file for reproducability.
  - Visualize the data when applicable.
- Create a decision trees.........................
- Create 2-5 slides in Google Slides to suitable for a general audience.
- Present 5-6 minutes to peers.
